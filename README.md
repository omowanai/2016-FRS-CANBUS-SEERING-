# 2016-FRS-CANBUS-SEERING-
 This is a simple arduino code to send can messages to activate the eps syestem on a 2016 scion frs. 
 Upload to arduino with a canbus shield, power up and output to can lines at obd2 port ( pins 6 can hi and pin 14 can lo ) 
 if for some reason the code doesnt work, you might be able to get another board/ code to send, just transfer the id and data, and know the messages need to be sent at 100 times per second,
